Description Logics Description Logics About the Workshops The description logic workshops are the main international event of the description logic research community. They take place annually and aim at being an informal get-together that allows researchers to discuss the current developments in the area. The workshops explicitly welcome submissions from researchers that are new to the area and provide quality feedback via peer-reviewing while at the same time being of an "inclusive" nature with a very high acceptance rate. There are only informal (electronic) proceedings and "publication" at the workshop is not supposed to preclude publication at conferences.
